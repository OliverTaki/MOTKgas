Summary for the last 2 weeks:

# Scope

* Centralize page styling by moving per-page CSS (esp. `viewer.html`) into `COMMON_styles.html`.
* Keep page structure stable: `gNav`, `pNav`, table view, detail view.

# What we changed

* Created sectioned, full-file `COMMON_styles.html` with numbered blocks.
* Restored your toolbar layout and offsets on the table page.
* Reinstated table vertical borders (cell right borders + header sticky).
* Implemented sticky footer (`#statusBar`) pattern.
* Unified scrollbar styling; then adjusted to “detail-like” colors.
* Preserved detail page styles in a separate section to avoid cross-impact.

# What broke / open issues you reported

## Table page

* No vertical and horizontal scrollbars visible (should exist on `#tableWrap`/`#table-view-container`).
* Pagination footer not visible.
* Need an extra vertical line on the far right of the table (outer border).

## Detail page

* Toolbar missing.
* Horizontal scrollbar missing.
* Grid/content shifted downward unexpectedly (likely spacer/offset mismatch).

# Current target state

* Table page: visible X/Y scrollbars, sticky pagination footer, outer right border line.
* Detail page: toolbar restored, horizontal scrollbar visible, grid positioning corrected.

# Agreed process

* Edit by full file or full section only.
* No temporary hiding tricks.
* Minimal diffs from last “good” state; if a change regresses, revert to the prior good section.
* After table page is fixed, address detail page.

If you want, I can produce a short CHANGELOG.md with dated entries matching these steps.
